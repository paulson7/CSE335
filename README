This is still kind of confusing. There is a lot to process, but it seems to be an uber-powerful way to manage code versions.

Not really using it correctly right now... but maybe to start a project from and work from it. Need a computer with github for it to be useful.

But maybe not. Gonna try to build some android stuff.
